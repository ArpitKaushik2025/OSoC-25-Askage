Before contributing, you need to install a local copy of this Chrome extension in your browser.  
_Please make sure you're using a Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, Brave, or Opera._

## Installation

First, clone the entire repository to your system. Then run this script to install all dependencies:

```sh
cd frontend  # Navigate to the frontend directory
npm install
```

## Install Chrome Extension (One-Time Setup)

Once everything is set up, follow these steps to install the Chrome extension in your browser for testing:

1. Run `npm run build`. This will generate a `/dist` directory.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browser and enable **Developer mode** from the top-right corner.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button, and select the `/dist` directory that was just generated.
4. Click the extensions icon in your browserâ€™s address bar to view all installed extensions.
5. Youâ€™ll see **Askage** listed there. Click the **Pin** icon to make it easily accessible.

Hurray! ðŸŽ‰ Askage is now installed in your browser!

## Reload Extension

Whenever you make changes to the frontend code, youâ€™ll need to reload the extension to see the updates. Hereâ€™s how:

1. In the `/frontend` directory, run `npm run build` to rebuild the extension.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and click the **Reload** button for the Askage extension.

All done! ðŸŽ‰ Your changes to Askage are now live.

> [!TIP]
> Keep the `chrome://extensions` page open in a separate tab during development, as you'll need to reload the extension frequently after making changes.
